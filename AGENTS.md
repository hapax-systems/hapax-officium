# hapax-officium Agent Instructions

This repository belongs to Hapax and must remain under `hapax-systems`. Do not
create, move, or point Hapax repository automation at `ryanklee`.

## Review Guidelines

External GitHub App reviewers such as CodeRabbit, Claude, and Codex are
advisory. Their comments can be useful input, but they are not authoritative
merge or release gates unless a governed Hapax task explicitly routes them into
the review process.

- Keep Codecov and Semgrep advisory signal sources unless a governed task
  promotes a specific stable aggregate context.
- Preserve the `all-green` aggregate for branch protection and release tooling.
- Do not print or persist plaintext secrets; use GitHub Secrets, `pass`, or
  `hapax-secrets`.
- For cross-plane changes, keep source, runtime, and governance evidence
  separate in the PR notes and tests.
